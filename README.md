# Bread Unit

## What is it?

This is a bread unit calculator for diabetics. My son lives with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), so I created this small service for our family as well as for other people who live with diabetes.

1 bread unit (BU) corresponds to food amounts that contains 10-12 grams of digestible carbohydrates. Calculator converts quantity of particular food from grams to BU and vice versa. You can choose food from the default list or just specify carbohydrate value (carb per 100g of food).

If you have any questions, critique or suggestions for this project - please [email me](mailto:me@dshevchenko.biz).

**Please note that I'm not endocrinologist and this service cannot be treated as an official medical nutrition guide for diabetics.**
